Inspired by the Lybniz educational grapher, pyGrapher will (besides
probably eventually being renamed,) support unlimited functions, plots
of points, functions of y (allowing graphs of vertical lines) saving and
loading sets of functions to a file, and exporting the graph as an
image. This list is probably not complete.
